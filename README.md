## Introduction

**nfcore/nanoseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that can be used to perform basecalling, demultiplexing, mapping and QC of Nanopore DNA/RNA sequencing data.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Pipeline Summary

1. Basecalling and/or demultiplexing ([`Guppy`](https://nanoporetech.com/nanopore-sequencing-data-analysis) or [`qcat`](https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat); *optional*)
2. Sequencing QC ([`pycoQC`](https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC), [`NanoPlot`](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot))
3. Raw read QC ([`NanoPlot`](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot), [`FastQC`](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
4. Alignment ([`GraphMap2`](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/graphmap2) or [`minimap2`](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2))
    * Both aligners are capable of performing unspliced and spliced alignment. Sensible defaults will be applied automatically based on a combination of the input data and user-specified parameters
    * Each sample can be mapped to its own reference genome if multiplexed in this way
    * Convert SAM to co-ordinate sorted BAM and obtain mapping metrics ([`SAMtools`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html))
5. Create bigWig ([`BEDTools`](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/), [`bedGraphToBigWig`](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/)) and bigBed ([`BEDTools`](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/), [`bedToBigBed`](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/)) coverage tracks for visualisation
6. Present QC for alignment results ([`MultiQC`](https://multiqc.info/docs/))

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install one of [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/)

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/nanoseq -profile test,<docker/singularity/institute>
```

> Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

iv. Start running your own analysis!

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/nanoseq \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --protocol DNA \
    --input_path ./fast5/ \
    --flowcell FLO-MIN106 \
    --kit SQK-LSK109 \
    --barcode_kit SQK-PBK004 \
    -profile <docker/singularity/institute>
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline. An example input samplesheet for performing both basecalling and demultiplexing can be found [here](assets/samplesheet.csv).
